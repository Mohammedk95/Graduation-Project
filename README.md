## *Pothole And Crack Detection Using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)*

## **1. Introduction**  
- Most transportation relies on paved roads.  
- Poor road conditions (potholes, cracks) cause vehicle damage and accidents.  
- The project aims to develop a **road defect detection system** using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**.  

## **2. Dataset & Data Processing**  
- The dataset originates from:  
  **J. Rashid, A. Ghulam, & I. Ahmad. (Feb 2023) - ResearchGate**
- **Dataset Details:**  
  - **Original dataset:** 6,000 images (3 classes: Potholes, Cracks, Normal roads).

## **3. Model & Implementation**  
- Implemented using **Python** and **Keras library**.  
- Training performed on **Google Colab Pro GPU (A100)**.  
- **CNN-based models used for training and evaluation:**  
  - Custom CNN  
  - **VGG-16 & VGG-19 (Transfer Learning applied)**  

## **4. Performance Metrics**  
- **Accuracy & F1-Score:**  
  - Achieved **99.37% accuracy** with **VGG-16 & VGG-19**.  
  - **F1-Score:** **0.99**  
- **Evaluation Metrics Used:**  
  - **Accuracy, Loss, and F1-Score**  
  - **Performance visualized using curves & tables**
